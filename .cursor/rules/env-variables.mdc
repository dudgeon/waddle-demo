the file .env exists; please always look at it before talking about variables

## Required Process:
1. If `read_file` fails to find .env, immediately use terminal commands:
   - `find . -name ".env" -type f` to locate it
   - `cat .env` to read its contents
2. NEVER assume the .env file doesn't exist if file reading tools fail
3. ALWAYS use terminal commands as a fallback for hidden files
4. Read the .env contents BEFORE making any assumptions about environment variables or configuration

## Why This Matters:
- Hidden files (.env) may not be accessible via standard file reading tools
- Terminal commands are more reliable for finding and reading hidden files
- The .env file contains critical configuration that affects all development decisions
